# ONTO: A Protocol for Recognition. An Economy of Ideas.

## The Fracture
Innovation is gridlocked. Patent offices protect corporations, not inventors. Academic journals hold knowledge in years-long queues. Funding decisions are made in boardrooms, not by communities. Between the speed of thought and the inertia of institutions lies a fracture.

**ONTO is a direct bridge across this fracture.**

## The ONTOnew Territory
This is not a platform. It is new ground, where rules are shaped by the natural progression of ideas.

* **Publications.** Finished knowledge. Establish priority and share your work—without intermediaries.
* **Ideas.** Raw thought. Stake your concept and create defensive prior art—instantly and freely.
* **Projects.** Live development. Find resources and collaborators to bring your vision to life.

**Our axiom:** Visibility is protection. Community is strength.

## The Core: The ONTO and NEW Ecosystem Tokens
The ONTOnew protocol operates on a dual-token economic model, ensuring both long-term value stability and efficient operational utility.

### **ONTOnew (Golden Status)**
* **Role:** Store of Value / Digital Nobel Prize.
* **Status:** **Ownership Renounced**. The contract is immutable and fully decentralized.
* **Contract Address:** `EQA95hQqnN5LdpOOA82SoO2fs35TCzRKXhDeSb3JHi1Xlo7n`

### **ontoNEW (Silver Status)**
* **Role:** Operational Currency / Utility Token.
* **Status:** Managed by the protocol for scalable ecosystem rewards.
* **Contract Address:** `EQA4CJKnzXOfbDOwwvqCs97Ar_iqN0SIkabtDqucZvpb2gjg`

* **How it works:** You find work that matters to you. To support its author, you send them **NEW**. Directly.
* **What it changes:** The author gains NEW tokens and will be able to change them to **ONTO**.
* **Our stance:** Both ONTO and NEW are utility tools. Their value lies in usefulness, not speculative promise.

## Choice and Commitment
You can support any author directly by sending any asset on the TON network to their wallet. ONTOnew.com exists for those who choose to go a step further.

In 2026 the ONTO token (TON network) will be introduced as the native currency of recognition. Choosing to earn, hold, or transfer ONTO is a conscious act:

1. It directly supports an author with a liquid asset.
2. It stakes a claim on the future of this protocol.

## Inviolable Principles
* **The Inviolability of Authorship.** Priority is permanently recorded.
* **Direct Patronage.** No intermediaries. From person to person.
* **Utility Over Speculation.** Value lies in useful action.
