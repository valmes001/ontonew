# ONTO: A Protocol for Recognition. An Economy of Ideas.

## The Fracture
Innovation is gridlocked. Patent offices protect corporations, not inventors. Academic journals hold knowledge in years-long queues. Funding decisions are made in boardrooms, not by communities. Between the speed of thought and the inertia of institutions lies a fracture. 

**ONTO is a direct bridge across this fracture.**

## The ONTOnew Territory
This is not a platform. It is new ground, where rules are shaped by the natural progression of ideas.

*   **Publications.** Finished knowledge. Establish priority and share your work—without intermediaries.
*   **Ideas.** Raw thought. Stake your concept and create defensive prior art—instantly and freely.
*   **Projects.** Live development. Find resources and collaborators to bring your vision to life.

**Our axiom:** Visibility is protection. Community is strength.

## The Core: The ONTO and NEW Ecosystem Tokens
The ONTOnew protocol operates on a dual-token economic model, ensuring both long-term value stability and efficient operational utility.

**ONTOnew (Golden Status)**
    *   **Role:** Store of Value / Digital Nobel Prize.
    *   **Status:** Ownership Renounced. The contract is immutable and fully decentralized. No further emission is possible.
    *   **Utility:** Recognition of outstanding intellectual contributions and high-tier scientific patronage.
    *   **Contract Address:** `EQA95hQqnN5LdpOOA82SoO2fs35TCzRKXhDeSb3JHi1Xlo7n`

**ontoNEW (Silver Status)**
    *   **Role:** Operational Currency / Utility Token.
    *   **Status:** Managed by the protocol for scalable ecosystem rewards.
    *   **Utility:** Used for community voting, rewarding authors, and micro-transactions within the ONTOnew territory.
    *   **Contract Address:** `EQA4CJKnzXOfbDOwwvqCs97Ar_iqN0SIkabtDqucZvpb2gjg`

*   **How it works:** You find work that matters to you. To support its author, you send them NEW. Directly.
*   **What it changes:** The author gains NEW tokens and will be able to chenge the to ONTO. This way you enact direct patronage by voting with NEW, bypassing all bureaucratic layers.
*   **Our stance:** Both ONTO and NEW are utility tools. Thier primary value lies in its usefulness to the ecosystem, not in speculative promise.

## Choice and Commitment
You can support any author directly by sending any asset on the TON network to their wallet. ONTOnew.com exists for those who choose to go a step further.

In 2026 the ONTO token (TON network) will be introduced as the native currency of recognition within this ecosystem. Choosing to earn, hold, or transfer ONTO is a conscious act that does two things:

1. It directly supports an author with a liquid asset.
2. It stakes a claim on the future of this protocol. 

The value of ONTO will be a reflection of the collective belief in and growth of the ONTOnew ecosystem. By using ONTO, you are not just donating. You are voting for a future where recognition has its own economy.

### Our stance is one of radical transparency: 
ONTO is a utility with emergent network value. Its fundamental worth is the function it provides; its potential price is a measure of the ecosystem’s health.

## Inviolable Principles
*   **The Inviolability of Authorship.** Priority is permanently recorded.
*   **Direct Patronage.** No intermediaries. From person to person.
*   **Utility Over Speculation.** Value lies in useful action.
*   **Full Transparency.** All rules and mechanisms are open.

We are building a protocol for those tired of waiting for the system’s permission to think and create. If you believe an idea should belong to its author, and support should be direct—this territory is for you.
