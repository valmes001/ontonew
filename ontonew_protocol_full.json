  "core_philosophy": {
    "the_fracture": "Innovation is gridlocked. Patent offices protect corporations, not inventors. Academic journals hold knowledge in years-long queues. Funding decisions are made in boardrooms, not by communities. Between the speed of thought and the inertia of institutions lies a fracture. ONTO is a direct bridge across this fracture.",
    "axiom": "Visibility is protection. Community is strength."

      "description": "Share Your Idea. Secure Your Priority. The patent system is broken. Share your concept publicly, create prior art instantly, and maintain your claim as the originator. Fast, free, and formidable.",
      "purpose": "Raw thought. Stake your concept and create defensive prior art—instantly and freely."

    "publications": {
      "description": "Publish Your Research. Own Your Priority. Share your complete work. Establish public authorship and a verifiable timestamp. Bypass slow journals, own your narrative fast and free!",
